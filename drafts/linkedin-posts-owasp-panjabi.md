# LinkedIn Posts — OWASP ASVS Panjabi Translation

## Post 1: Announcement (Long-form)

130+ million Panjabi speakers. Zero access to OWASP's Application Security Verification Standard in their language.

Until now.

I've submitted the first-ever Panjabi (Gurmukhi) translation of OWASP ASVS 5.0 — PR #3254: https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3254

But this isn't a typical translation. Every section is bilingual: English first, Panjabi below. Here's why that matters:

Security terminology is precise. "Authentication" and "authorization" aren't interchangeable — and neither are their Panjabi equivalents. Bilingual format gives developers comprehension in their language AND technical precision from the English source.

We also built a 100+ term security glossary with a T/L/R/H classification:

- Translated: Authentication → ਪ੍ਰਮਾਣੀਕਰਨ
- Loan word: API → ਏ.ਪੀ.ਆਈ.
- Retained: OWASP, SQL, XSS
- Hybrid: SQL Injection → SQL ਇੰਜੈਕਸ਼ਨ

Phase A (Frontispiece, Preface, glossary) is live. Phases B–D cover all 17 ASVS chapters through August 2026.

Looking for Panjabi-speaking security professionals to review. 15 minutes of your time on the PR makes a real difference.

## Post 2: Question Hook (Short)

How do you translate "SQL Injection" into Panjabi?

Short answer: you don't. Not entirely.

That's one of the 100+ terminology decisions I had to make while creating the first-ever Panjabi translation of OWASP ASVS 5.0.

Some terms translate naturally. Some stay in English. The interesting ones are hybrids.

I wrote about the methodology and why it matters for 130M+ Panjabi speakers:

## Post 3: Community Call (Medium)

Calling Panjabi-speaking security professionals 🙏

I'm leading the first Panjabi translation of OWASP ASVS 5.0 — the application security standard used globally to verify secure software.

I need reviewers who can check that security concepts translate accurately into Gurmukhi script.

What's involved:

- Open PR #3254 on GitHub (https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3254)
- Read any .md file in 5.0/pa-IN/
- Leave inline comments on terminology or phrasing
- 15 minutes makes a genuine impact

You don't need to be a native speaker AND a security expert. Either qualification helps. Linguists catch script issues. Security folks catch technical gaps. Both matter.

Tag someone who speaks Panjabi and works in tech. They might not know this opportunity exists.

## Post 4: Digital Seva Angle (Short)

In Sikh philosophy, seva means selfless service.

Digital Seva applies that principle to technology — the belief that technical knowledge shouldn't be gatekept behind language barriers.

OWASP ASVS 5.0 is the gold standard for application security. It's been translated into 6 languages. Never into Panjabi. Never into any South Asian language.

That changes now: https://securityleader.ai/blog/owasp-asvs-panjabi-translation
