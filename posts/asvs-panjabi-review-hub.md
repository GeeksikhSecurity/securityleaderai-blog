# OWASP ASVS Panjabi Translation — Review Hub

> **Your feedback matters.** You do not need a GitHub account to review this translation. Read the content below, then email your feedback to **gurvinder@securityleader.ai** with the subject line **"ASVS Panjabi Review"**. Even a single correction or suggestion is valuable.

## What Is This?

The [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) is the global benchmark for application security requirements — 350 requirements across 17 chapters that architects, developers, and security teams use to build and verify secure software.

This is the **first-ever translation of ASVS into Panjabi** (ਪੰਜਾਬੀ), reaching 130+ million speakers worldwide. The translation uses a **bilingual format** — English first, Panjabi (Gurmukhi script) immediately below — so readers can cross-reference for technical precision.

The translation is being submitted to the official OWASP ASVS repository as [a proposed contribution (PR #3254 on GitHub)](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3254).

## What to Review

Phase A is complete. Three documents are ready for review:

| Document | What It Contains | Link |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| **Title Page** (ਮੁੱਖ ਪੰਨਾ) | Project credits, copyright, license, contributors | [Read Title Page](/blog/asvs-panjabi-review-frontispiece) |
| **Introduction** (ਮੁਖਬੰਧ) | ASVS 5.0 introduction, principles, levels, scope | [Read Introduction](/blog/asvs-panjabi-review-preface) |
| **Glossary** (ਸ਼ਬਦਾਵਲੀ) | 100+ security terms with Gurmukhi translations | [Read Glossary](/blog/asvs-panjabi-review-glossary) |

## Who Should Review

You do not need to be both a Panjabi speaker AND a security expert — either qualification helps:

- **Panjabi speakers:** Does the translation read naturally, or does it feel like a forced word-for-word conversion? Are there better Gurmukhi equivalents for any term?
- **Security researchers:** Is the English source meaning preserved? Do any translations introduce ambiguity that could affect a developer's implementation?
- **Gurmukhi linguists:** Any Devanagari script contamination? Proper vowel signs (ਮਾਤਰਾ)? Clean Unicode?

## Understanding the Glossary — Translation Approaches

Every translated term in the glossary is classified by its translation approach (T/L/R/H):

| Category | When Used | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **T — Translated** | Concept has a natural Panjabi equivalent | Authentication → ਪ੍ਰਮਾਣੀਕਰਨ |
| **L — Loan Word** | Term is universally used in English | API → ਏ.ਪੀ.ਆਈ. |
| **R — Retained** | Acronym or proper noun, kept as-is | OWASP, SQL, XSS |
| **H — Hybrid** | Part translates, part stays in English | SQL Injection → SQL ਇੰਜੈਕਸ਼ਨ |

## Timeline

| Phase | Content | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **A** (Complete) | Title Page, Introduction, Glossary, Translation Notes, Review Plan | February 2026 |
| **B** | Core chapters: Architecture, Authentication, Session Management, Access Control | March–April 2026 |
| **C** | Remaining 13 security requirement chapters | May–July 2026 |
| **D** | Appendices, final quality checks, PDF generation, community review window | August 2026 |

## How to Send Feedback

**Email** (easiest): Send to **gurvinder@securityleader.ai** with subject **"ASVS Panjabi Review"**

Include any of the following:
- A term you think should be translated differently (e.g., *"I think ਕਮਜ਼ੋਰੀ works better as ਖ਼ਾਮੀ for Vulnerability"*)
- A Gurmukhi spelling or vowel sign correction
- A sentence that reads unnaturally and a suggested alternative
- General impressions of the bilingual format

**GitHub** (for Git-comfortable reviewers): Open [PR #3254](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/pull/3254) and leave inline comments on any file in `5.0/pa-IN/`.
